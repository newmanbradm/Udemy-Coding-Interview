##Identifying Runtime Complexity

######Iterating with a simple for loop through a single collection?
Probably O(n)

######Iterating through half a collection?
Still O(n). There are no constants in runtime (so n/2 does not exist)

######Iterating through two ***different*** collections with separate for loops?
O(n + m)
