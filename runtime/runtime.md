##Contant Time 
###1 or O(1)
No matter how many elements we're working with, the algorithm will always take the same amount of time

##Logarithmic Time
###log(n) or O(log(n))
You have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn't double the amount of work. Always assume that searching operations are log(n)

##Linear Time
###n or O(n)
Iterating through all elements in a collection of data. If you see a for loop spanning from '0' to 'array.length', you probably have 'n', or linear runtime
